        <h1>Letters of Recommendation</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Ask and You Shall Receive</p>

        <section>
            <p>In a time of grade inflation and shifting views on test blindness, a teacher's letter of recommendation
                potentially carries a lot of weight in a student's application for college admission or scholarship
                programs. This is an uncomfortable spot to be in considering that there is no feedback cycle for these
                letters; even if a student is selected, it is never clear how much weight a LoR carried in that
                decision.</p>

            <p>I have two objectives when writing a letter for a student: sharing my personal insights and corroborating
                their personal information. In an ideal case, I can provide perspective on a student in a variety of
                contexts; the dream scenario is a students that I have taught, coached, and supported in some
                extracurricular. This lets me distill a fundamental story where I can share traits and qualities that
                the student always carries with them. These anecdotes should also align with the story the student is
                trying to tell in their own writing as well. My letter might be the only outside qualitative information
                in an application so I hope it canm serve as proof of a student's veracity in their own writing.</p>
