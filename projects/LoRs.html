        <h1>Letters of Recommendation</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Ask and You Shall Receive</p>

        <section>
            <p>In a time of grade inflation and shifting views on test blindness, a teacher's letter of recommendation
                potentially carries a lot of weight in a student's application for college admission or scholarship
                programs. This is an uncomfortable spot to be in considering that there is no feedback cycle for these
                letters; even if a student is selected, it is never clear how much weight a LoR carried in that
                decision.</p>

            <p>I have two objectives when writing a letter for a student: sharing my personal insights and corroborating
                their personal information. In an ideal case, I can provide perspective on a student in a variety of
                contexts; the dream scenario is a students that I have taught, coached, and supported in some
                extracurricular. This lets me distill a fundamental story where I can share traits and qualities that
                the student always carries with them. These anecdotes should also align with the story the student is
                trying to tell in their own writing as well. My letter might be the only outside qualitative information
                in an application so I hope it canm serve as proof of a student's veracity in their own writing.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What to Provide</h2>
            <p>A few essentials: how to submit the LoR, its due date, and any specific prompts I must address. If I know
                a student well, that should be all that I need but there are some other things that can help. The
                easiest thing would be reminders of some factual information: what class(es) did I teach you in and when
                was that? If you have any other documents already prepared for an app like a resume those can also let
                me add more context to a letter. The best thing you could do is let me know what stories you feel are
                essential that I tell; some things should better coming from a teacher rather than the applicant and I
                want to make sure I cover those points if applicable. I do not want you to attempt to write the letter
                for me, but it helps me pick what to prioritize in the time and space I have to write.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>My Structure</h2>
            <p>Unless there is a truly exceptional story to tell, my letters typically take on the following structure:
                context, insights, and potential. Context is the easiest part to write (and is typically required by
                most institutes). It is an overview of how long I have known you and specifics of those settings that
                will shape the rest of the letter. For example, was it a required course or an elective or
                extracurricular you chose to participate in? This is especially important for settings like AP electives
                that can demonstrate a particular strength or interest in a topic.</p>

            <p>With that out of the way I can get to the fun part of writing: what I have been able to observe in my
                role(s) and what can be gleaned from those insights. I can't turn off my Science writing habits, I start
                with the raw (usually anecdotal) data and then provide my analysis on what it implies.</p>
