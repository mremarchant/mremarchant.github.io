        <h1>The Dying Internet</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">And What You Can Do About It!</p>
        <section>
            <p>The Internet is an amazing feat of innovation and collaboration. We have connected the world through
                miles of
                cables and countless electromagnetic signals. We created a global platform where anyone with access can
                speak and be heard. The Internet is powered by the people who use it, and as Uncle Ben said, "with
                great power comes great responsibility." The potential of the internet is at risk, so here is what we
                can do
                about that.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Incentives and Deceptions</h2>
            <p>You came to this site for a reason. Every time you head online, you have a goal. It could be to buy
                something, do some research, or just pass the time, but you always have had an objective. Every site you
                have been on has a goal. It is trying to sell you something, teach you, entertain you, or just keep you
                engaged so you end up viewing more ads. More often than not, your reasons are not fully congruent with
                the site's goals.</p>
            <p>This isn't (necessarily) evil, it's economics. Running a website isn't free, owning a url costs
                monthly fees on top of all of the effort that went into constructing and maintaining the site. It is
                fair to expect that the team that put their time and efforts into the site receive compensation. With
                online stores it is clear how this happens, but what about all of the "free" sites?</p>
            <p>Probably ad views and collecting (and selling) your data. Every time you see an ad online, the platform
                that sent it your way earns a fraction of a cent for their efforts. That's why social media sites want
                to keep you scrolling and streaming videos want to autoplay. It is also why ad blockers are an ethical
                gray area - those ads are how you are supporting the creators who made the work you are trying to see!
                If a site isn't directly delivering ads, it could also be supporting advertisers by selling your email
                address and other PII (since you let them do that in the Terms of Service you are obligated to
                agree to). This is all reasonable - we go to a site for goods and services so we should expect to offer
                some sort of compensation in return. Unfortunately, some sites go too far and break this social contract
                with their users. </p>
            <p>These sites use deceptive patterns to manipulate users. They take advantage of principles of design that
                should be used to benefit a site and instead try to get users to act against their best interests. Best
                case is that these cause minor inconvenience but at their worst a deceptive site could lead to
                significant financial harm. There are some laws in place to combat these actions, but the line between
                advertisement and deception is just as blurry online as it is off.</p>

            <h2>Rot and Drift</h2>
            <p>Deceptive patters are hard to prevent due to the actual nature of the internet. The internet is a
                collection of agreed-upon protocols that manage the transfer of data between devices. It's a postal
                service for computers! These rules make sure the transfer of information is precise and reliable, but
                they also have no bearing on what that information actually is.</p>
            <p>When you use an internet browser to navigate to the website, you use a URL like www.MrMarchant.com to
                find the content you want to see. It's like sending a letter to a specific address to request a letter
                back. Links on websites work the same way - they are just the text of the address that you want your
                computer to navigate to when clicked. So what happens when someone moves and changes address?</p>
            <p>The Supreme Court found out the hard way! Websites are not dynamic by default, they are a static set of
                code that makes the site you see. If there is an address linked in the site that is no longer valid, the
                developer of the site has to make a point of changing the link or else it will lead to the wrong place.
                This is link rot, and it is getting worse every single year. Running a website is not free, so older
                websites might go down. Or sites might change their address without redirecting anyone trying to access
                their old URL.</p>
            <p>Link rot is bad but at least it makes itself known. A more uncomfortable issue is content drift. The
                address is still valid, but the residents have changed.</p>
