        <p class="subtitle">And What You Can Do About It!</p>
        <section>
            <p>The Internet is an amazing feat of innovation and collaboration. We have connected the world through
                miles of cables<label for="sn-usc" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

                electromagnetic signals. We created a global platform where anyone with

            <p>You came to this site for a reason. Every time you head online, you have a goal. It could be to buy
                something, do some research, or just pass the time, but you always have had an objective. Every site you
                have been on has a goal. It is trying to sell you something, teach you, entertain you, or just keep you
                engaged so you end up viewing more ads<label for="sn-sfv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="sn-sfv" class="margin-toggle">
                <span class="sidenote">This is why short form video content is so popular! It keeps a user watching and
                    it is easy to work in ads between every few short clips. </span>. More often than not, your reasons
                are not fully congruent with
                the site's goals.
            </p>
            <p>This isn't (necessarily) evil, it's economics. Running a website isn't free, owning a url costs
                monthly fees<label for="sn-url" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="sn-url" class="margin-toggle">

                    would cost me even more!</span> on top of all of the effort that went into constructing and
                maintaining the site. It is
                fair to expect that the team that put their time and efforts into the site receive compensation. With
                online stores it is clear how this happens, but what about all of the "free" sites?
            </p>
            <p>Probably ad views and collecting (and selling) your data. Every time you see an ad online, the platform
                that sent it your way earns a fraction of a cent for their efforts<label for="sn-apay"
                    class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

                        target="_blank">Maybe like $0.001</a> but there are a ton of variables at play like how targeted
                    the ad is and if anyone actually clicks through. </span>. That's why social media sites want
                to keep you scrolling and streaming videos want to autoplay. It is also why ad blockers are an ethical
                gray area - those ads are how you are supporting the creators who made the work you are trying to see!
                If a site isn't directly delivering ads, it could also be supporting advertisers by selling your email
                address and other PII<label for="sn-pii" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

                obligated to
                agree to). This is all reasonable - we go to a site for goods and services so we should expect to offer
                some sort of compensation in return. Unfortunately, some sites go too far and break this social contract
                with their users.

                should be used to benefit a site and instead try to get users to act against their best interests. Best
                case is that these cause minor inconvenience but at their worst a deceptive site could lead to
                significant financial harm<label for="sn-emo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

                actions, but the line between
                advertisement and deception is just as blurry online as it is off.

            <h2>Rot and Drift</h2>
            <p>Deceptive patterns are hard to prevent due to the actual nature of the internet. The internet is a
                collection of agreed-upon protocols that manage the transfer of data between devices<label for="sn-btb"
                    class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

                postal
                service for computers! These rules make sure the transfer of information is precise and reliable, but
                they also have no bearing on what that information actually is.
            </p>
            <p>When you use an internet browser to navigate to the website, you use a URL like
                <em>www.MrMarchant.com</em> to
                find the content you want to see. It's like sending a letter to a specific address to request a letter
                back. Links on websites work the same way<label for="sn-tdk"

                    target="_blank">This is link rot</a>, and it is getting worse every single year. Running a website
                is not free, so older
                websites might go down. Or sites might change their address without redirecting anyone trying to access
                their old URL. Link rot is bad but at least it makes itself known. A more uncomfortable issue is <a
                    href="https://sketchplanations.com/content-drift" target="_blank">content
                    drift</a>. The address is still valid, but the residents have changed.

            </p>

            <h2>Veracity</h2>
            <p>This all has assumed that the online sources are worth using, but believe it or not, not everything you
                can read online is true! Traditional data verification strategies<label for="sn-dvs"

                <input type="checkbox" id="sn-dvs" class="margin-toggle">

                research, and the advent of widespread generative AI has added to the pile of questionable information
                that must be filtered through. Sparing the details<label for="sn-mc"
                    class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="sn-mc" class="margin-toggle">
                <span class="sidenote">If you want an AI term to show off, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17493v2"
                        target="_blank">model collapse</a> is the feedback loop of bad AI-generated content
                    training other generative AI models leading to absolute nonsense.</span>, it is easier than
                ever to use code to generate
                entire websites of AI output. AI programming does not acknowledge truth, AI code does not process facts,
                AI works using frequency. It outputs popular answers<label for="sn-cgp"
                    class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="sn-cgp" class="margin-toggle">
                <span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9OHn5ZF4Uo" target="_blank">CGP Grey's
                        video</a> gives a great overview of how this happens.</span>, not correct ones.
            </p>
            <p>The best strategy to deal with this is to do the tedious thing: seek out primary sources. When using
                human-made sites this is straightforward: most sites still cite their sources! For example on Wikipedia
                you can directly go to the source of any information via the citations and references at the bottom of
                any article! With how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/style/ai-search-slop.html"
                    targer="_blank">AI slop</a> has invaded search engines, it can be a bit more difficult to find those
                initial sites to work off of. Using a <a href="https://www.google.com/advanced_search"
                    target="_blank">search engine's built in tools and filters</a> can be a huge help with
                this - for example, isolating a search for only .pdf would make it more probable to have an actual
                research paper show up! Using tools like <a href="https://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank">Google
                    Scholar</a> or having your site support access to an academic library can also make this much more
                doable.</p>

            <h2>Overcoming the Algorithm</h2>
            <p>Another place invaded by AI generated content is social media feeds. Most platforms use code to
                <a href="https://funginstitute.berkeley.edu/news/op-ed-social-media-algorithms-their-effects-on-american-politics/"
                    target="_blank">decide what you see on your homepage</a>. It will deliver content that will get the
                most engagement from
                you, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp555xy5ro" target="_blank">even if it isn't
                    quality</a>. With social media <a
                    href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/social-media-and-news-fact-sheet/"
                    target="_blank">becoming a primary method to get news for a lot of
                    folks</a>, this can be disastrous. One way to avoid this would be to develop your own news stream!
                This can
                be as simple as subscribing to trusted sources via email or making a point to have your feeds deliver
                your posts chronologically.
            </p>
            <p>Another way to curate new online content is through RSS. RSS is a protocol that lets websites broadcast
                their updates so you can see them all in one place. By curating your own RSS feed, you can have control
                over what information is delivered to you without concern about an outside source changing the formula
                for what you see.</p>
