    <h1>AI Fundamentals for Educators</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Can A Computer Even Have Intelligence?</p>

    <section>
      <p>AI will have the same transformative impact on society as cars. Most drivers don't know how their car works but
        they use them constantly. Personal vehicles transformed American culture and shaped the constructed world around
        us, for better or for worse. Teachers need to know the fundamentals of AI-driven programming to best prepare
        their students for the world they will inhabit.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>What Even Is A Computer? What Even Is Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>AI programs work on fundamentally the same hardware that any other computer does, albeit with different scales
        or priorities. So to understand the strengths and limits of AI code, it is essential to remember the strength
        and limits of computers in general. In its code, a computer is an adding machine. Modern computers appear to go
        beyond addition by storing specific mathematical processes and routines; it's similar to the progression in how
        math processes are taught from adding to multiplying to taking averages and so on. So then how can a
        superpowered calculator end up writing an essay or generating a video? It doesn’t, it tricks us into thinking it
        did! </p>

      <p>What makes human intelligence special is that we can transform data into information. Data is simply that which
        is given, like beads on a rod or lights on a screen. Intelligence is being able to understand that as numbers
        counted on an abacus or the display on a calculator. Right now you are looking at a grid of lights in different
        colors, that’s all, and that’s all the computer needs to know. But you understand the patterns of these lights
        as letters, the letters as words, words to sentences, and you are creating information from that data.
        Computers, and thus AI programs, create displays of data and your brain does the heavy lifting of turning those
        patterns into information.</p>

      <h2>Teaching a Machine</h2>
      <p>How does a computer make such convincing patterns in data? It finds the patterns that have been there all
        along! AI programming relies on using a large amount of data to “train” the computer program to output data that
        looks similar, but not identical to, the original data. I could never do a more efficient job of explaining it
        compared to this CGP Grey explainer: </p>

      <p>An AI program is code that uses statistical processes to predict outcomes that resemble what was present in the
        training data. There are two major takeaways here: these programs are using probability and they are fully
        reliant on the data used to set those odds. Probability is a tricky thing; it’s easy to talk about the odds of a
        coin toss but you have never seen a coin land on 50% heads and 50% tails. We are used to computers providing
        answers with certainty but AI methods add an element of chance to these trusted processes. </p>
