    <h1>AI Fundamentals for Educators</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Can A Computer Even Have Intelligence?</p>

    <section>
      <p>AI will have the same transformative impact on society as cars. Most drivers don't know how their car works but
        they use them constantly. Personal vehicles transformed American culture and shaped the constructed world around
        us, for better or for worse. Teachers need to know the fundamentals of AI-driven programming to best prepare
        their students for the world they will inhabit.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>What Even Is A Computer? What Even Is Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>AI programs work on fundamentally the same hardware that any other computer does, albeit with different scales
        or priorities. So to understand the strengths and limits of AI code, it is essential to remember the strength
        and limits of computers in general. In its code, a computer is an adding machine. Modern computers appear to go
        beyond addition by storing specific mathematical processes and routines; it's similar to the progression in how
        math processes are taught from adding to multiplying to taking averages and so on. So then how can a
        superpowered calculator end up writing an essay or generating a video? It doesn’t, it tricks us into thinking it
        did! </p>

      <p>What makes human intelligence special is that we can transform data into information. Data is simply that which
        is given, like beads on a rod or lights on a screen. Intelligence is being able to understand that as numbers
        counted on an abacus or the display on a calculator. Right now you are looking at a grid of lights in different
        colors, that’s all, and that’s all the computer needs to know. But you understand the patterns of these lights
        as letters, the letters as words, words to sentences, and you are creating information from that data.
        Computers, and thus AI programs, create displays of data and your brain does the heavy lifting of turning those
        patterns into information.</p>

      <h2>Teaching a Machine</h2>
      <p>How does a computer make such convincing patterns in data? It finds the patterns that have been there all
        along! AI programming relies on using a large amount of data to “train” the computer program to output data that
        looks similar, but not identical to, the original data. I could never do a more efficient job of explaining it
        compared to this CGP Grey explainer: </p>

      <figure class="iframe-wrapper">
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9OHn5ZF4Uo?si=t1rAqH2_fV9ZM8Ij"

      </figure>

      <p>An AI program is code that uses statistical processes to predict outcomes that resemble what was present in the
        training data. There are two major takeaways here: these programs are using probability and they are fully
        reliant on the data used to set those odds. Probability is a tricky thing; it’s easy to talk about the odds of a
        coin toss but you have never seen a coin land on 50% heads and 50% tails. We are used to computers providing
        answers with certainty but AI methods add an element of chance to these trusted processes. </p>


      <h2>It's All Data</h2>
      <p>The datasets that are used in the training process serve as the "answer key” for the program output, which
        means the programs can only be as accurate as the data that feeds it. There is an abundance of data available
        out there, but quantity is not quality nor is it accuracy. Data comes from humans and humans carry biases and
        flaws. Scale and mathematics do not clean these issues out of a dataset, they exacerbate it. </p>

      <p>The prevalence of AI-driven technology has also created an enormous push for more data collection. There is a
        demand to datafy everything, and that changes the way we interact with technology. It can be frustrating, but it
        also provides us with a lens to better understand what AI can actually mean. When you see something “powered by
        AI”, ask yourself what data it is relying on. What patterns does the code rely on to generate outputs? Is this a
        situation where you want the most popular answer - because that is what the statistics of the program will lean
        towards.</p>


      <h2>For Teachers</h2>
      <p>Teaching about AI is no different than teaching about any other information technology. As teachers we need to
        emphasize critical consumption of information online, whether it is from an AI program or any other source. The
        humanized presentation that AI applications use make them extremely convincings<label for="sn-con"
          class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-con" class="margin-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote"><a href="https://resobscura.substack.com/p/openais-new-study-mode-and-the-risks"
            target="_blank">Digital tutors</a> are probably the most agressive examples of this. Nothing in their code
          makes them accurate.</span> and so it is essential that we
        prepare students to approach this information with a skeptical lens. It doesn’t mean they need to automatically
        assume everything is wrong, but there should always be a deliberate effort to verify information beyond just
        feeling like it’s correct.
      </p>

      <p>A more difficult task that we should aspire to is to do our best to not anthropomorphize technology, especially
        AI programs. When we give human qualities to computers, it changes the way we evaluate the data they present. It
        creates an artificial sense of trust and effort when the human elements of the technology are much farther
        removed. We can’t forget the humans that made the hardware and software we frequent, but that does not mean that
        their creations are the same as the creators. This is an uphill battle, especially with the prevalence of AI
        agents and assistants marketed to appear mortal, but the effort is essential for our students’ understanding.
      </p>

      <h2>My Hot Take</h2>
      <p>AI should not save you any time. Instead it should improve the work you are capable of in the same amount of
        time. Any AI generated output lacks veracity, you need to put in the work to proofread and verify anything from
        writing to images to code. If you use AI to give feedback to students, you still need to go through every page
        to make sure it is right and to see where your class is headed. </p>

      <p>If AI does cut down on the time something takes, that task probably did not require that much energy anyways.
        Maybe that email could have just been one sentence. That slideshow didn’t need images on every single page. It
        would have been faster to read an article than to listen to a generated voice. Maybe you missed something
        important when you read only the summary. </p>

      <p>When I started teaching, assigning a poster project would be a multiday event. Accessible graphic design tools
        can cut the visual elements down and I get a choice - do I make this a one day assignment or ask for higher
        quality work? This is what AI does to our practice across mediums.</p>
