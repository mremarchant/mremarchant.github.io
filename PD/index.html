      <h2>Topics of Interest</h2>
      <h3><a href="/PD/AIforEdu.html">Artificial Intelligence for Educators</a></h3>
      <p>AI will have the same transformative impact on society as cars. Most drivers don't know how their car works but
        they use them constantly. Personal vehicles transformed American culture and shaped the constructed world around
        us, for better or for worse. Teachers need to know the fundamentals of AI-driven programming to best prepare
        their students for the world they will inhabit.</p>

      <h3><a href="/PD/deadinternet.html">The Dying Internet</a></h3>
      <p>The protocols of the internet are beautiful works of engineering that ensure robust communication online. But
        they do not have any bearing on the content that is shared. Contradictory incentives and automation have eroded
        the quality of information on the internet. Teachers need to be ready to adapt to this changing Internet and
        equipt their students with research skills to navigate what is out there.</p>

      <h3><a href="/PD/CTforEdu.html">Computational Thinking</a></h3>
      <p>Problem solving is a metacognitive skillset that all classrooms use. Students would benefit from these skills
        being explicitly acknowledged as they are practiced. Being able to deliberately utilize abstraction,
        decomposition, and pattern recognition can unlock new insights for both students and teachers and can empower
        all to face the challenges of a tech-driven world.</p>

      <h3><a href="/PD/EfET.html">Ethics of Emerging Technology</a></h3>
      <p>"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."
      </p>

      <h3><a href="/PD/DnDnD.html">Dungeons & Dragons & Design for Learning</a></h3>
      <p>I consume a lot of D&D and TTRPG content. Being part of an adventuring party isn't much different than being a
        student, so how can I take tropes of an adventure to make my classroom more engaging? You'll need at least 1d20
        to participate.</p>

      <h3>What Else?</h3>
      <p>I am always on the lookout for relevant topics to share with my students, especially in STEM. Abstract,
        high-level themes especially intrigue me, like emergent properties and design thinking. Please feel free to
        share any topics in these veins that I could organize resources around.</p>
