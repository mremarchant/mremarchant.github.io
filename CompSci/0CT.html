        <p class="subtitle">Think Like A Computer To Work With One</p>
        <section>
            <p>Computational Thinking is a set of problem solving strategies and frameworks that help make complex
                issues more manageable. This unit will use games and practical examples to practice techniques like
                abstraction and decomposition to take on full-stack computational problems.

            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <h3>Welcome to Computer Science!</h3>
            <p>This course will survey the most common topics that make up the study of Computer Science. This is quite
                a lot to ask for a single class - English gets at least 13 years and there is still always more to
                cover! So what does it mean to study Computer Science? It means taking the time to examine the
                strategies and techniques you use to approach new problems like finding out which student is in the
                middle of the class in terms of age!</p>
            <p>In academics, CompSci is defined as the study of algorithms. An algorithm is a process or procedure. It’s
                a plan with a purpose! If you are taking this course, you should already be familiar with lots of
                different algorithms from your Math and Science classes. Processes like using the quadratic formula or
                balancing a chemical equation are algorithms. They are a set of steps you follow to solve a problem. In
                this class we won’t be following algorithms, we will be taking a metacognitive step back to develop
                them. We don’t like solving the same problems twice.</p>
            <p>Creating an algorithm is called programming. It’s the art of organizing logical steps to achieve a goal.
                You’ve seen things like event programs that organize ceremonies and concerts. Programming does not
                strictly require a computer or code, though technology is usually useful when solving most programming
                problems. Coding is the specific art of writing instructions for a computer, but just like squares and
                rectangles, all coding is programming but not all programming requires code.</p>
