    <p class="subtitle">For the Curious</p>

    <section>
      <p>I have been a STEM teacher for a decade, starting my career teaching at Hoover High in SDUSD and The Preuss
        School at UC San Diego. I am currently a teacher, coach, tech coordinator, and department chair at Whitney High
        School in ABCUSD. </p>

      <h2>Pedagogy Philosophy</h2>

      <p>Why teach? I need money to exchange for goods and services. I also want confidence in the constructed world
        around me. To adopt an idea from John Green
        <label for="sn-Green" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-Green" class="margin-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote">"It's because I don't like living in a country full of stupid people." - <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nosq94oCl_M" target="_blank"> John Green </a></span>
        , I believe in the importance of a well-educated society and I want to help shape the structures that actively
        support me. This means that my practice needs to be focused on the long term rather than the short few months
        that students spend in my class. I need to craft experiences and opportunities that leave lasting impressions.
      </p>

      <p>At the end of the day, I need to prepare my students to face the problems of the world around them. If the big
        problems of the world were easy, they would be solved already. Within the day-to-day scope of my class, I
        instead hope to give students the opportunity to practice the translatable skills that they will need to
        eventually approach the big picture. Most importantly, I hope to make learning a positive experience. From
        having clear expectations to taking the time to find beauty in the content
        <label for="sn-Feyn" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-Feyn" class="margin-toggle">
        <span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRmbwczTC6E" target="_blank"> From Feynman's
            Idea of Beauty </a></span>
        , I hope to help show my class the benefits of being a lifelong learner. Hopefully they can efficiently carry on
        that pursuit and improve the world around us.
