      <p>Speedrunning culture fascinates me. Speedrunning, where people try to clear games as fast as possible, does
        not. But the community that has developed around it and the tools it has brought forth hit all of the right

      <p>I assume that witnessing these discoveries in speedrunning evoke the same thrills as monumental moments in
        science. We can never witness the joy of Faraday and his motor, but every new game brings new opportunities for
        luck, skill, and determination to bring about these new sparks.</p>
