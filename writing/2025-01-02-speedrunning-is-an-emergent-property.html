      <p>Speedrunning culture fascinates me. Speedrunning, where people try to clear games as fast as possible, does
        not. But the community that has developed around it hit all of the right notes to draw my attention. The videos
        by Lowest Percent do a great job of highlighting what makes it so special:

      <p>Witnessing these discoveries and oddities in speedrunning evoke the same thrills as monumental moments in
        science. We can never witness the joy of Faraday and his motor, we can never experience playing with magnets for
        the first time again, but every new game brings opportunities for luck, skill, and determination to bring about
        these sparks. There is a special joy to discovery and speedrunning sets the stage for this to be brought forth
        again and again.</p>
      <p>I draw these parallels not just for the humor of it. Both of these arise from the discovery of emergent
        properties - those special moments when the sum has transcended its parts. Everything is an emergent
        property of some more fundamental principle<label for="sn-emerg" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

            target="_blank">Mostly.</a></span>. Temperature is the kinetic energy of a collection of molecules. Rainbows
        are just the diffraction of light. Weather is applied thermodynamics.
        What's fascinating is that emergent properties are difficult to predict. Coulomb's Law
        doesn't clearly lead to circuits. Intermolecular forces don't obviously cause friction. Programmers don't
        intentionally create glitches. These outcomes are (usually) discovered instead of derived; first principles can
        imply some grander outcomes, but these properties are not problems that were solved.
