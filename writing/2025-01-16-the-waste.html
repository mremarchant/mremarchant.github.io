            <p>A consultant at their device. <em>Write an email to explain why teachers should attend my AI
                    training.</em> Sends it out.
            </p>

            <p>A teacher gets an email. Paragraphs of text, generic images. <em>Summarize this.</em> It's an invite to a
                training. Paid, maybe free breakfast, might as well.</p>

            <p><em>Create a presentation. Lots of bright colors and smiling faces! Make handouts.</em> Everyone in the
                audience is on their laptop, maybe their phone too. <em>Write a script, make sure to include some
                    humor!</em> Everyone gives a thumbs up when asked if they understand. Everyone gets paid. Lots of
                grading got done. Tax dollars at work. Classes are still the same.</p>
